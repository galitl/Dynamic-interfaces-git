			<h3 style=" font-family:helvetica; text-align: left; padding: 4px; width: 650px; margin: 16px auto;">In daily life</h3>
			<h5 style=" font-family:helvetica; text-align: left; padding: 4px; width: 650px; margin: 16px auto;">Around the turn of the 20th century, bicycles reduced crowding in inner-city tenements by allowing workers to commute from more spacious dwellings in the suburbs. They also reduced dependence on horses. Bicycles allowed people to travel for leisure into the country, since bicycles were three times as energy efficient as walking and three to four times as fast.</h5>
			<h5 style=" font-family:helvetica; text-align: left; padding: 4px; width: 650px; margin: 16px auto;">A number of cities around the world have implemented schemes known as bicycle sharing systems or community bicycle programs. The first of these was the White Bicycle plan in Amsterdam in 1965. It was followed by yellow bicycles in La Rochelle and green bicycles in Cambridge. These initiatives complement public transport systems and offer an alternative to motorized traffic to help reduce congestion and pollution. In Europe, especially in the Netherlands and parts of Germany and Denmark, bicycle commuting is common. In Copenhagen, a cyclists' organization runs a Cycling Embassy that promotes biking for commuting and sightseeing. The United Kingdom has a tax break scheme (IR 176) that allows employees to buy a new bicycle tax free to use for commuting.</h5>
			<h5 style=" font-family:helvetica; text-align: left; padding: 4px; width: 650px; margin: 16px auto;"> In the Netherlands all train stations offer free bicycle parking, or a more secure parking place for a small fee, with the larger stations also offering bicycle repair shops. Cycling is so popular that the parking capacity may be exceeded, while in some places such as Delft the capacity is usually exceeded. In Trondheim in Norway, the Trampe bicycle lift has been developed to encourage cyclists by giving assistance on a steep hill. Buses in many cities have bicycle carriers mounted on the front.</h5>

			<h5 style=" font-family:helvetica; text-align: left; padding: 4px; width: 650px; margin: 16px auto;">There are towns in some countries where bicycle culture has been an integral part of the landscape for generations, even without much official support. That is the case of √çlhavo, in Portugal.</h5>
			<h5 style=" font-family:helvetica; text-align: left; padding: 4px; width: 650px; margin: 16px auto;">In cities where bicycles are not integrated into the public transportation system, commuters often use bicycles as elements of a mixed-mode commute, where the bike is used to travel to and from train stations or other forms of rapid transit. Some students who commute several miles drive a car from home to a campus parking lot, then ride a bicycle to class. Folding bicycles are useful in these scenarios, as they are less cumbersome when carried aboard. Los Angeles removed a small amount of seating on some trains to make more room for bicycles and wheel chairs.</h5>
			<h5 style=" font-family:helvetica; text-align: left; padding: 4px; width: 650px; margin: 16px auto;">Bicycles offer an important mode of transport in many developing countries. Until recently, bicycles have been a staple of everyday life throughout Asian countries. They are the most frequently used method of transport for commuting to work, school, shopping, and life in general. In Europe, bicycles are commonly used. They also offer a degree of exercise to keep individuals healthy.</h5>
