			<h5 style=" font-family:helvetica; text-align: left; padding: 4px; width: 650px; margin: 16px auto;">A bicycle, often called a bike (and sometimes referred to as a "pushbike", "pedal bike", "pedal cycle", or "cycle"), is a human-powered, pedal-driven, single-track vehicle, having two wheels attached to a frame, one behind the other. A bicycle rider is called a cyclist, or bicyclist. </h5>

			<h5 style=" font-family:helvetica; text-align: left; padding: 4px; width: 650px; margin: 16px auto;">Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century in Europe and now number more than a billion worldwide, twice as many as automobiles.They are the principal means of transportation in many regions. They also provide a popular form of recreation, and have been adapted for use as children's toys, general fitness, military and police applications, courier services, and bicycle racing. </h5>
			<h5 style=" font-family:helvetica; text-align: left; padding: 4px; width: 650px; margin: 16px auto;"> The basic shape and configuration of a typical upright, or safety bicycle, has changed little since the first chain-driven model was developed around 1885. But many details have been improved, especially since the advent of modern materials and computer-aided design. These have allowed for a proliferation of specialized designs for many types of cycling.</h5> 
			<h5 style=" font-family:helvetica; text-align: left; padding: 4px; width: 650px; margin: 16px auto;">The bicycle's invention has had an enormous effect on society, both in terms of culture and of advancing modern industrial methods. Several components that eventually played a key role in the development of the automobile were initially invented for use in the bicycle, including ball bearings, pneumatic tires, chain-driven sprockets, and tension-spoked wheels.</h5>
